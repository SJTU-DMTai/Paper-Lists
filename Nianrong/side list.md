| VLDB'25     | Birdie: Natural Language-Driven Table Discovery Using Differentiable Search Index | Yunjun Gao & Mingwei Zhou | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21282)   | `TP` | This paper introduces Birdie, an NL-driven table discovery framework using a differentiable search index (DSI). It trains an encoder-decoder Transformer to store table repository indexes in its parameters, assigns unique tabids to tables, teaches the model to map tables/synthetic queries to tabids, and enables the trained model to generate tabids token by token from queries during inference (search). To accommodate the continual indexing of dynamic tables, an index update strategy via parameter isolation is proposed, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting.
| VLDB'25     | Auto-Prep: Holistic Prediction of Data Preparation Steps for Self-Service Business Intelligence | Yeye He & Surajit Chaudhuri  |  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11627)    | `TP` | Auto-prep is an automatic data preparation technique that consider table joining and data transformation in a holistic manner for BI scenario (dashboarding, etc.). In this paper, the authors formalize the Most-Probable BI-Prep (MPBP) problem, as finding the most likely data preparation (join and transform) steps, for a given set of input tables. Then, the authors proposed Auto-prep, a holistic methods for predicting the data preparation steps, addresses the disjoint optimization of transformation and join by first training enhanced offline models (MOP, XGBoost, etc.) that takes single table and global features as input and returns normalized probabilities of atom operations as output and then constructing transformation trees + a global search graph online, converting the MPBP problem into a Steiner tree problem for efficient joint optimization of table transformations and inter table joins.

Three main data problems are emphasized in this work, Missing Semantics(a needed column missed), Inconsistent Value(values appears in different forms in a certain column) and Irrelevant column. AutoPrep decomposes the data prep process into three stages: planning stage, programming stage and executing stage. Planner will generate an SQL-like Analysis Sketch similar to Binder(ICLR'23), outlining how the table should be transformed to produce the answer. In programming stage, Programmer agents translate a high-level logical plan into a physical plan by generating low-level code, which is then passed to an Executor agent for code execution and interactive debugging. |
| SIGMOD'25   | Pneuma: Leveraging LLMs for Tabular Data Representation and Retrieval in an End-to-End System | Raul Castro Fernandez  |   [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09207) | `TP` | Pneuma system is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to efficiently discover tabular data. It does not only consider the table content information but also the context information. The system will firstly utilize LLM's knowledge to normalize provide meaningful column descriptions, even for abbreviations or domain-specific terms that may be challenging for humans or smaller models to interpret. Then, it use embedding model to generate vector representation of the table with context. In retrieval stage, the system will retrieves tables based on the user query 𝑄 by integrating three signals: lexical (BM25), semantic (vector search), and a signal based on LLM judgment. |

This system decomposes the reasoning task into four stage: pre-process stage, planning stage, code execution stage and answer extraction stage. Planner decomposes the query into several sequential subtasks, each of them could be done by either SQL or LLM. And a secondary LLM is assigned to verify the initial plan. Following planning, the Weaver executes the plan sequentially, combining SQL queries and LLM-generated prompts. In the final pipeline stage, the intermediate table and user query are inputted to an LLM, which generates a natural language answer.|

Then, it generates code to pull out the data rows and columns relevant to the query, along with performing necessary operations like filtering or calculations. Next, an external tool runs this code to get accurate results, preventing the model from making up information. These results are then presented clearly. Finally, the model uses its reasoning ability to analyze these results and derive the final answer to the query. For large tables that exceed token limits, the pipeline first compresses them by identifying and keeping only the most relevant data, while adding back potentially useful information to ensure key details aren’t lost, before proceeding with the above steps.

It uses a lightweight contrastive learning method to train column encoders in an unsupervised way. The encoding of each column also considers other columns within a table, thus capturing the contextual semantics. It then encodes columns in the data lake as vectors and builds an HNSW index to accelerate the search. |

For the operations exceeding SQL capabilities, BINDER assigns an LLM to complete the task via APIs, treating it as a special new identifier in grammar and a node in ASTs. The result returned from the LLM is stored as a variable compatible with the standard symbolic language grammar for deriving the final result.

| ICDE'20    | Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes | Nikolaos Konstantinou |  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10427)    | `TP` | In this paper, the authors provide a formal definition of dataset discovery in data lakes. Subsequently, a method named D³L (Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes) is proposed for this task. Specifically, D³L defines the distance between tables by leveraging the core insight that the smaller the distance between two tables, the higher their similarity. Therefore, we could build data lake indexes to do retrieval. By constructing an LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) forest, D³L is enabled to efficiently identify related tables within a data lake.
