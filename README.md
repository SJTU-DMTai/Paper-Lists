# Paper-Lists
This repository maintains the reading lists of our group in a consistent and reviewable form. Each member owns a personal folder that contains at least a primary reading list. Optional materials such as reading reports and side reading lists can be added to the same folder. The repository aims to make progress visible, reduce duplication, and preserve high-quality notes for future reference.

NOTE: Each paper entry in the paper list should **at least** include the full title, the venue (e.g., SIGMOD'25, arxiv2509), a stable link, and the corresponding author.
